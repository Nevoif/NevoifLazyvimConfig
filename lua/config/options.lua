-- Options are automatically loaded before lazy.nvim startup
-- Default options that are always set: https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/blob/main/lua/lazyvim/config/options.lua
-- Add any additional options here
vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable(false)

-- yoo i forgot this file even exists
-- i moved my csharp config to lua/plugins/dotnet.lua and lua/plugins/roslyn.lua
-- so this file is useless now
-- but i will keep it here just in case i want to add some global options later
-- like tab size or something
-- but for now i will just leave it empty
-- you can delete it if you want
-- but i will keep it for now
-- peace out i guess
-- maybe i will add some options later
-- who knows
-- bye
-- i said bye     
-- i am bored
-- ok bye for real now
-- i will stop writing comments now
-- ok bye
